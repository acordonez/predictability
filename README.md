Scripts for the paper "Processes controlling Arctic and Antarctic sea ice predictability in the Community Earth System Model"

These scripts contain the analysis Matlab code used as the basis of this paper. 
Certain colormaps and netcdf utilities may not be included but should be obtainable from Mathworks if desired.
Not all of the region map scripts are included, but the masks are.
The satellite observations are not included but can be obtained from https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0079.
The model runs used are control runs from the CESM large ensemble project. Note that we do not use the 
historical period ensemble, just the 1850's controls. More information about these simulations
is available here: http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/community-projects/LENS/

These scripts were written and run on the NCAR Yellowstone and Cheyenne computers / Geyser cluster.
